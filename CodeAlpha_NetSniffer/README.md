# CodeAlpha - Basic Network Sniffer

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship.

#Overview
A simple Python-based network sniffer built using **Scapy**.
It captures live network packets and prints:

- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Protocol (TCP/UDP)
- Timestamp
- Packet Length
Packets can also be saved to a PCAP file.
### Step 1 — Activate virtual environment

### Step 2 — Run sniffer (sudo required)

### Step 3 — View PCAP in Wireshark
Open the generated `.pcap` file in Wireshark for analysis.

##  Dependencies
All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Scapy
- Wireshark
- Ubuntu (WSL)
