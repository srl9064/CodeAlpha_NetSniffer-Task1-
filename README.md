# CodeAlpha – Basic Network Sniffer (Cybersecurity Internship)

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship – Task 1.  
It implements a **Python-based network packet sniffer** using the Scapy library.  
The tool captures live network packets, analyzes them, and logs useful information for cybersecurity analysis.

---

## Overview

This network sniffer captures real-time traffic and displays:

- **Source IP Address**
- **Destination IP Address**
- **Protocol (TCP / UDP / ICMP)**
- **Packet Length**
- **Timestamp**

It can also save all captured packets to a `.pcap` file so they can be opened in Wireshark for further analysis.
